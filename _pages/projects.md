## Frame-to-Frame ego-motion estimation for agile drones with Convolutional Neural Network (MSc Thesis)

Openly available feature-based Visual Odometery algorithms have a high computational cost. This hinders the use of these algorithms in agile robotics platforms such as racing drones. A wide range of researchers has looked into, using data-driven learning methods such as Deep Learning, instead, the use of traditional feature-based methods for developing a new class of visual odometry systems. These systems have mainly relied on datasets designed for low degree-of-freedom systems such as cars. Hence, even this new class of algorithms, suffer from high computational cost and inability to handle agile robotics systems. Therefore, this research will look into developing a learning-based visual odometry system, specifically designed for racing drones, which can handle high-speed agile motion with a low computational cost.

## A Quadcopter with Automated Take-off And Landing on Mobile Robot Platform (MEng Thesis)

In this thesis, a controller is designed for an off the shelf quadcopter to give it the ability to autonomously takeoff, hover at a given altitude, follow and land on a mobile robot platform. This is a small part of a much bigger system which is a quadcopter and a mobile robot combined fully autonomous surveillance system. The (bigger) system can navigate and complete a given task without any human interaction. 

Different types of sensor are used to determine the position of the quadcopter in 3D space. A discrete PID controller will be used to hold the altitude of the quadcopter. Real-time image processing is used to determine the position of the quadcopter relative to the mobile robot platform. An ideal quadcopter simulation and a 3D simulation of the task is done to understand in detail how a quadcopter works and how to controller it the way we desire. Kalman filter is used to produce accurate and precious angular data of the quadcopter.

## FPGA Based Real Time Eye Tracking System

In this project, an FPGA based real-time eye-tracking system will be implemented based on algorithms that will be tested on MATLAB. The mentioned system will be implemented with an FPGA development board and a camera module. The system will track the userâ€™s eyes and output a corresponding indication to the output display. The real-time video stream also will be on the same output display. The main aspects of FPGA based eye-tracking systems are the accuracy, speed, robustness, power consumption and cost. In this project, my main objective is to implement a system with high accuracy.
